Steps:

1)Create CSP trusted site
2)Import above fetchData lwc 
3)Generate access toten in git and update in lwc.
4)update endpoint url with your url.

This lwc component saved my time in terms of writting apex and test class.

I took time to understand github API.I faced difficulty in forming valid endpoint url.But once it is ready didnot take much time to achieve this.

There are some know issues:
1) NO data type is done on Add functionality.
2) Error handling is not for all scenario.
3) Reload and render functionality,spinner can be added.
